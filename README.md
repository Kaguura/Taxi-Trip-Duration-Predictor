# Taxi-Trip-Duration-Predictor
The objective of the project is to predict the time required for taxi-cab trips from a point A to point B. It will not only enable better time management amongst customers but also augment earning of taxi-cab drivers providing better trip acceptance. Academically, the project will provide better insights into data mining techniques especially in the domain of regression.
